This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## General description

This is a small application tied to [simple-api](https://github.com/szpone/simple-api). It uses its API to display
simple data. You have to run both client-simpe and simple-api in
order to use all features of this application. Instructions on running simple-api can be found in its README.

## Storybook

Storybook is a tool for creating components in isolation and can act as a portfolio of all components in
different states. It also eases development process. To start story book run:

### `npm storybook`
or
### `yarn storybook`


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` 
or
### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm start` 
or
### `yarn start`



Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
Note that also this command starts Storybook tests.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
